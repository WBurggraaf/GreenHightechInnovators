Project Submission

**Summary | A brief overview of your project | 100**

The project tackles Impact Framework plugin challenges by re-engineering it into a user-friendly API for simpler manifest file creation and plugin development. It introduces four innovative sustainability plugins (vehicle-embodied carbon, weather impact prediction, EV charging emissions, and package delivery emissions) to boost sustainability efforts. Supported by a fictitious EV fleet sustainability case study, the project's clear README files and comprehensive analyses extend beyond carbon emissions to educate users. Additionally, tools like a plugin and simulation API application streamline Impact Framework use and spur innovation. Key innovation includes empowering developers with a simulator. The goal is to foster an accessible Impact Framework, nurturing a data-driven sustainability development community.

Problems the Project Addresses

The Impact Framework, while a powerful sustainability analysis tool, suffers from inherent complexity. This complexity manifests in the creation of manifest files, hindering adoption and potentially leading to inaccurate analysis. Additionally, while plugins offer flexibility, their development process can remain challenging. This complexity, along with a conventional focus on carbon emissions, obscures the true potential of the Impact Framework for new users.

How the Project Solves These Problems

Our project tackles these challenges head-on. By reimagining the Impact Framework as an accessible API, we radically simplify interaction for users working with manifest files. This lowers the barrier to entry and reduces the chances of errors. We also provide extensive documentation and a fake EV fleet sustainability case study to enhance understanding.  Additionally, our plugins expand the focus to include embodied carbon, water usage, and other key sustainability metrics. Lastly, we've added a specific tool – a simulation API – to further empower users.  These combined efforts make the Impact Framework significantly more accessible, fostering a thriving and innovative development community.

**Application | Describe what the solution actually does | 200**

Our solution empowers delivery companies to optimize their EV fleet operations for maximum environmental benefit. It achieves this through several key components:

Holistic Impact Assessment: Custom plugins for the Green Software Foundation's Impact Framework go beyond carbon emissions. They calculate embodied carbon, water usage, and waste generation throughout a vehicle's lifecycle, providing a comprehensive view of the fleet's environmental footprint.

Weather Impact Predictions: The solution analyzes how various weather conditions influence EV range and battery health. This enables proactive route adjustments and charging strategies for weather-optimized performance.

Grid-Aware Charging Optimization: Fleet managers can schedule charging to coincide with peak renewable energy generation periods on the grid. This minimizes the emissions associated with charging and potentially reduces costs.

Data-Driven Route Analysis: The solution analyzes planned routes, factoring in real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle performance data. This enables the identification of the most energy-efficient and emissions-conscious routes.

Proactive Maintenance Insights: Battery health projections allow for predictive maintenance scheduling. This extends the vehicle's lifespan, reduces unexpected downtime, and minimizes the long-term environmental impact.

Overall, our solution provides comprehensive tools and insights for delivery companies to make informed decisions that prioritize environmental sustainability in their EV fleet operations.

Why our project fits perfectly

API-Driven Simplicity: Transforming the Impact Framework into an API fundamentally simplifies interaction. This directly benefits users creating and running manifest files, reducing complexity and minimizing the potential for errors.

Focus on Usability: our fake case study [PDF](https://github.com/WBurggraaf/GreenHightechInnovators/raw/main/The%20Green%20Mile.pdf), clear README files, and diverse plugins demonstrate a focus on user-friendliness. This empowers new users to grasp the power of the Impact Framework and apply it beyond solely carbon emission analyses.

Supplemental Tools: our 4 additional plugins and simulation API application act as powerful extensions of the core framework. They offer further flexibility and specialized functionality, making the Impact Framework significantly more adaptable and approachable across various use cases. We sincerely hope to inspire scientists and specialists to build upon what we have started.

Key Takeaway: our project prioritizes streamlining the core user experience with the Impact Framework. This directly addresses the criteria of making it "easier to use" for both manifest file interactions and, indirectly, for plugin development by establishing a more intuitive foundation.

Our solution development process emphasized collaboration and iteration:

Ideation: We brainstormed potential plugins and features to enhance the Impact Framework's capabilities.

Planning: Using Azure DevOps scrum board, we structured tasks focused on individual plugins, simulators, API integration, and UI development.

Development: Prioritizing TypeScript ensured alignment with the Impact Framework's design. Pair programming and frequent discussions facilitated collaboration.

Adaptation: We remained flexible, shifting towards an API-driven architecture, resulting in additional simulator creation.

Alignment: Weekly meetings ensured progress, addressed challenges, and refined the solution for a cohesive outcome.

**Inspiration | Tell us what inspired you to develop the solution | 150**

Picture this: a whirlwind brainstorming session fueled by a shared passion for sustainability and a sprinkle of tech geekery! One of us throws out "logistics optimization," another mentions Picnic's EV grocery deliveries and the discord buzzes with the complex beauty of charging logistics and electronics. Suddenly, the intricate dance of routes, optimization, and a story about vehicle inspections and weather-dependent charging strategies takes center stage.

It's a eureka moment! We envision a solution built on the Impact Framework – custom plugins quantifying often-overlooked factors like embodied water usage and waste generation throughout a vehicle's lifecycle. We see the potential to predict weather-driven battery performance and align charging with renewable energy peaks.
