# CO2.JS

> [!NOTE] > `CO2.JS` ([thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js)) is a community plugin, not part of the IF standard library. This means the IF core team are not closely monitoring these plugins to keep them up to date. You should do your own research before implementing them!

# Parameters

## Plugin global config

- `options`: **SWD Plugin Only** an object containing any Sustainable Web Design specific variables to the changed. All keys are optional.
  - `dataReloadRatio` - a value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of data that is downloaded by return visitors. -`firstVisitPercentage` - a value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of new visitors.
  - `returnVisitPercentage` - a value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of returning visitors.
  - `gridIntensity` - an object that can contain the following optional keys:
    - `device` - a number representing the carbon intensity for the given segment (in grams per kilowatt-hour). Or, an object, which contains a key of country and a value that is an Alpha-3 ISO country code.
    - `dataCenter` - a number representing the carbon intensity for the given segment (in grams per kilowatt-hour). Or, an object, which contains a key of country and a value that is an Alpha-3 ISO country code.
    - `networks` - A number representing the carbon intensity for the given segment (in grams per kilowatt-hour). Or, an object, which contains a key of country and a value that is an Alpha-3 ISO country code.

The value for `device`, `dataCenter`, or `networks` can be a number representing the carbon intensity for the given segment (in grams per kilowatt-hour). Or, an object, which contains a key of country and a value that is an Alpha-3 ISO country code.

## Plugin node config

- `type`: supported plugins by the library, `swd` or `1byte`
- `green-web-host`: true if the website is hosted on a green web host, false otherwise

## Inputs

- `network/data/bytes`: the number of bytes transferred or `network/data` if the number is in GB
- `duration`: the amount of time the observation covers, in seconds
- `timestamp`: a timestamp for the observation

## Returns

- `carbon-operational`: carbon emissions from the operation of the website, in grams of CO2e

# IF Implementation

IF utilizes the CO2JS Framework to calculate the carbon emissions of a website. The CO2JS Framework is a collection of plugins that calculate the carbon emissions of a website based on different parameters. IF installs the CO2js npm package from `@tgwf/co2js` and invokes its functions from a plugin plugin.

The CO2JS Framework is a community plugin, not part of the IF standard library. This means the IF core team are not closely monitoring these plugins to keep them up to date. You should do your own research before implementing them!

## Usage

In IF the plugin is called from an `manifest`. An `manifest` is a `.yaml` file that contains configuration metadata and usage inputs. This is interpreted by the command line tool, `ie`.

The plugin config should define a `type` supported by the CO2.JS library (either `swd` or `1byte`). These are different ways to calculate the operational carbon associated with a web application; `swd` is shorthand for 'sustainable web design' plugin and `1byte` refers to the OneByte mdoel. You can read about the details of these plugins and how they differ at the [Green Web Foundation website](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/explainer/methodologies-for-calculating-website-carbon/).

Each input is expected to contain `network/data/bytes` or `network/data`, `duration` and `timestamp` fields.

## Manifest

The following is an example of how CO2.JS can be invoked using an `manifest`.

```yaml
name: co2js-demo
description: example manifest invoking CO2.JS plugin
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    co2js:
      method: Co2js
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins'
      global-config:
        options:
          dataReloadRatio: 0.6
          firstVisitPercentage: 0.9
          returnVisitPercentage: 0.1
          gridIntensity:
            device: 560.98
            dataCenter:
              country: 'TWN'
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - co2js
      config:
        co2js:
          type: swd
          green-web-host: true
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          duration: 1
          network/data/bytes: 1000000
```

You can run this by passing it to `ie`. Run impact using the following command run from the project root:

```sh
npm i -g @grnsft/if
npm i -g @grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins
ie --manifest ./examples/manifests/test/co2js.yml --output ./examples/outputs/co2js.yml
```

This yields a result that looks like the following (saved to `/outputs/co2js.yml`):

```yaml
name: co2js-demo
description: example manifest invoking CO2.JS plugin
tags: null
initialize:
  plugins:
    co2js:
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins'
      method: Co2js
      global-config:
        options:
          dataReloadRatio: 0.6
          firstVisitPercentage: 0.9
          returnVisitPercentage: 0.1
          gridIntensity:
            device: 560.98
            dataCenter:
              country: TWN
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - co2js
      config:
        co2js:
          type: swd
          green-web-host: true
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          duration: 1
          network/data/bytes: 1000000
      outputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          duration: 1
          network/data/bytes: 1000000
          carbon-operational: 0.34497244224000007
```

## TypeScript

You can see example Typescript invocations for each plugin below.

### SWD

```typescript
import {Co2js} from '@grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins';

const globalConfig = {
  options: {
    // Optional

    firstVisitPercentage: 0.9,
    returnVisitPercentage: 0.1,
    gridIntensity: {
      device: 560.98,
      dataCenter: 50,
      networks: 437.66,
    },
  },
};
const co2js = Co2js(globalConfig);
const results = await co2js.execute(
  [
    {
      duration: 3600, // duration institute
      timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z', // ISO8601 / RFC3339 timestamp
      'network/data/bytes': 1000000, // bytes transferred
    },
  ],
  {
    type: 'swd',
    'green-web-host': true, // true if the website is hosted on a green web host, false otherwise
  }
);
```

### 1byte

```typescript
import {Co2js} from '@grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins';

const co2js = Co2js();
const results = await co2js.execute(
  [
    {
      duration: 3600, // duration institute
      timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z', // ISO8601 / RFC3339 timestamp
      'network/data/bytes': 1000000, // bytes transferred
    },
  ],
  {
    type: '1byte',
    'green-web-host': true, // true if the website is hosted on a green web host, false otherwise
  }
);
```
